<h1>Random Projects</h1>
These are some random projects I thought would be cool to make.

<strong>PS!</strong> Does not work on Safari, will work best on Chrome.

<h2>Issue Tracker</h2>
Simple issue tracker application where you can add issues, assign them a severity, description and also assign someone to take on the issue. You can also delete or close issues.
